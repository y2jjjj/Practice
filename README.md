### 📌 Problems Covered:

🔥 **Daily Temperatures** – Uses a *Monotonic Stack* to find the number of days until a warmer temperature.

⚡ **Next Greater Element I** – Combines *Stack* and *HashMap* to map each element to its next greater value in a second array.

🎯 **Two Sum II** – Utilizes the *Two Pointers* approach on a sorted array to find two numbers that add up to the target.

### 🛠️ Techniques Used:

* **Stack-based traversal** for optimizing brute force comparisons.
* **HashMap lookups** to quickly access relationships between elements.
* **Two Pointer shrink-and-scan** approach on sorted arrays.
* **Time and space complexity** considerations applied in every solution.
