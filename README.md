### 📌 **Problems Covered**

🔥 **Daily Temperatures** – Uses a *Monotonic Stack* to find the number of days until a warmer temperature.
⚡ **Next Greater Element I** – Combines *Stack* and *HashMap* to map each element to its next greater value in a second array.
🎯 **Two Sum II** – Utilizes the *Two Pointers* approach on a sorted array to find two numbers that add up to the target.
💧 **Trapping Rain Water** – Solves with an *Optimal Two Pointers* approach to calculate total trapped water in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

### 🛠️ **Techniques Used**

* **Stack-based traversal** for optimizing brute force comparisons
* **HashMap lookups** to quickly access relationships between elements
* **Two Pointer shrink-and-scan** approach on sorted arrays and height maps
* **Time and space complexity** optimization applied in all solutions
