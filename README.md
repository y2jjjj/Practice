### 📌 **Problems Covered:**

* 🔥 **Daily Temperatures** – Uses a **Monotonic Stack** to find the number of days until a warmer temperature.
* ⚡ **Next Greater Element I** – Combines **Stack** and **HashMap** to efficiently map each element to its next greater value in a second array.

---

### 🛠️ **Techniques Used:**

* Stack-based traversal for optimizing brute force solutions.
* HashMap for quick lookups and mapping relationships between array elements.
* Time and space complexity optimized solutions.
